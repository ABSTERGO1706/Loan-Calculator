# Loan-Calculator
It is just a simple project made to calculate loan amount using HTML ,CSS, and Javascript.
I made this to practice javascript. HTML,CSS are edited using AI. Javascipt is done my by own.
In this project, "Loan amount" , "Annual Interest" and " Years" are given as input.
The output consists of "monthly payment", "total payment" , "total interest amount".
